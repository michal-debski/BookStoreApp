# BookStoreApp
The application was developed to create Book Store management system.
To design this application I have used:
- Java 17,
- HTML to prepare views,
- Gradle
- Lombok,
- Spring boot,
- Spring Data JPA,
- Spring Web MVC,
- Tomcat,
- Thymeleaf,
- PostgreSQL
- Flyway.

For this project, I have created entities, services and DTO. 
This solution allows the user to communicate only with the DTO layer, not with the database itself. 
The request is then forwarded to the service layer, which communicates with the database layer.  

## Functionality
1. Create new book for store,
2. Edit book in store,
3. Delete book in store,
4. Add to "My books".
